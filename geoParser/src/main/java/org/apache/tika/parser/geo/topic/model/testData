In 1872 , the conflict climaxed with a final split between the two groups at the Hague Congress , where Bakunin and James Guillaume were expelled from the International and its headquarters were transferred to New York . 
In response , unions across America prepared a general strike in support of the event . 
Other active syndicalist movements include the US Workers Solidarity Alliance and the UK Solidarity Federation . 
For example , U.S. President McKinley 's assassin Leon Czolgosz claimed to have been influenced by anarchist and feminist Emma Goldman . 
Both wrote accounts of their experiences in Russia , criticizing the amount of control the Bolsheviks exercised . 
Platformist groups active today include the Workers Solidarity Movement in Ireland and the North Eastern Federation of Anarchist Communists of North America . 
Italian anarchists played a key role in the anti-fascist organisation Arditi del Popolo , which was strongest in areas with anarchist traditions , and achieved some success in their activism , such as repelling Blackshirts in the anarchist stronghold of Parma in August 1922 . 
In the U.K. this was associated with the punk rock movement , as exemplified by bands such as Crass and the Sex Pistols . 
It developed " mostly in Holland , Britain , and the U.S. , before and during the Second World War " . 
In New York 's Greenwich Village , bohemian feminists and socialists advocated self-realisation and pleasure for women ( and also men ) in the here and now . 
The first of these was started in New York City in 1911 . 
Another notable high albedo body is Eris , with an albedo of 0.86 . 
Over Antarctica they average a little more than 0.8 . 
Alabama ( i i i / l ə ˈ b æ m ə / ) is a state located in the southeastern region of the United States of America . 
It is bordered by Tenn. to the north , Georgia to the east , Florida and the Gulf of Mexico to the south , and Mississippi to the west . 
Alabama ranks 30th in total land area and ranks second in the size of its inland waterways . 
Following World War II , Alabama experienced growth as the economy of the state transitioned from agriculture to diversified interests in heavy manufacturing , mineral extraction , education , and technology . 
The capital of Ala. is Montgomery . 
The largest city by population is Birmingham . 
The largest city by total land area is Huntsville . 
Although the origin of Ala. could be discerned , sources disagree on its meaning . 
Ala. was part of the new frontier in the 1820s and 1830s . 
The economy of the central " Black Belt " was built around large cotton plantations whose owners built their wealth on slave labor . 
While few battles were fought in the state , Alabama contributed about 120,000 soldiers to the American Civil War . 
In 1900 , fourteen Black Belt counties had more than 79,000 voters on the rolls . 
The population growth rate in Ala. dropped by nearly half from 1910 -- 1920 , reflecting the effect of emigration . 
At the same time , many rural whites and blacks migrated to the city of Birmingham for work in new industrial jobs . 
It experienced such rapid growth that it was nicknamed " The Magic City " . 
By the 1920s , Birmingham was the 19th largest city in the U.S. and held more than 30 % of the population of the state . 
In addition , the state legislature gerrymandered the few Birmingham legislative seats to ensure election by persons living outside Birmingham . 
One result was that Jefferson County , containing Birmingham 's industrial and economic powerhouse , contributed more than one-third of all tax revenue to the state , but did not received a proportional amount in services . 
Alabama is the thirtieth largest state in the United States with 52,423 square miles ( 135,775 km² ) of total area : 3.19 % of the area is water , making Ala. twenty-third in the amount of surface water , also giving it the second largest inland waterway system in the United States . 
About three-fifths of the land area is a gentle plain with a general descent towards the Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico . 
The North Alabama region is mostly mountainous , with the Tennessee River cutting a large valley creating numerous creeks , streams , rivers , mountains , and lakes . 
The states bordering Alabama are Tennessee to the north ; Georgia to the east ; Florida to the south ; and Mississippi to the west . 
Ala. has coastline at the Gulf of Mexico , in the extreme southern edge of the state . 
Alabama ranges in elevation from sea level at Mobile Bay to over 1,800 feet ( 550 m ) in the Appalachian Mountains in the northeast . 
The highest point is Mount Cheaha , at a height of 2407 ft ( 734 m ) . 
Alabama 's land consists of 22 million acres ( 89000 km 2 ) of forest or 67 % of total land area . 
Suburban Baldwin County , along the Gulf Coast , is the largest county in the state in both land area and water area . 
Areas in Alabama administered by the National Park Service include Horseshoe Bend National Military Park near Alexander City ; Little River Canyon National Preserve near Fort Payne ; Russell Cave National Monument in Bridgeport ; Tuskegee Airmen National Historic Site in Tuskegee ; and Tuskegee Institute National Historic Site near Tuskegee . 
A notable natural wonder in Alabama is " Natural Bridge " rock , the longest natural bridge east of the Rockies , located just south of Haleyville , in Winston County . 
A 5-mile ( 8 km ) -wide meteorite impact crater is located in Elmore County , just north of Montgomery . 
This is the Wetumpka crater , which is the site of " Alabama 's greatest natural disaster " . 
The hills just east of downtown Wetumpka showcase the eroded remains of the impact crater that was blasted into the bedrock , with the area labeled the Wetumpka crater or astrobleme ( " star-wound " ) because of the concentric rings of fractures and zones of shattered rock that can be found beneath the surface . 
Temperatures tend to be warmer in the southern part of the state with its proximity to the Gulf of Mexico , while the northern parts of the state , especially in the Appalachian Mountains in the northeast , tend to be slightly cooler . 
Generally , Ala. has very hot summers and mild winters with copious precipitation throughout the year . 
Alabama receives an average of 56 inches ( 1400 mm ) of rainfall annually and enjoys a lengthy growing season of up to 300 days in the southern part of the state . 
Ala. is also prone to tropical storms and even hurricanes . 
Areas of the state far away from the Gulf are not immune to the effects of the storms , which often dump tremendous amounts of rain as they move inland and weaken . 
Ala. ranks seventh in the number of deaths from lightning and ninth in the number of deaths from lightning strikes per capita . 
The Super Outbreak in March 1974 , badly affected Alabama . 
The northern part of the state -- along the Tennessee Valley -- is one of the areas in the US most vulnerable to violent tornadoes . 
Alabama is one of the few places in the world that has a secondary tornado season ( November and December ) along with the spring severe weather season . 
Although snow is a rare event in much of Ala. , areas of the state north of Montgomery may receive a dusting of snow a few times every winter , with an occasional moderately heavy snowfall every few years . 
For example , the annual average snowfall for the Birmingham area is 2 inches per year . 
In the southern Gulf coast , snowfall is less frequent , sometimes going several years without any snowfall . 
The United States Census Bureau , as of July 1 , 2008 , estimated Alabama 's population at 4,661,900 , which represents an increase of 214,545 , or 4.8 % , since the last census in 2000 . 
Immigration from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 31,180 people , and migration within the country produced a net gain of 73,811 people . 
The Mobile area is notable for its large percentage of Catholics , owing to the area 's founding as part of the French colony of La Louisiane and later history under Spanish rule . 
The Southern Baptist Convention has the highest number of adherents in Alabama with 1,380,121 , followed by the United Methodist Church with 327,734 members , and the Catholic Church with 150,647 adherents . 
According to the United States Bureau of Economic Analysis , the 2008 total gross state product was $ 170 billion , or $ 29,411 per capita . 
Ala. 's agricultural outputs include poultry and eggs , cattle , plant nursery items , peanuts , cotton , grains such as corn and sorghum , vegetables , milk , soybeans , and peaches . 
Alabama 's industrial outputs include iron and steel products ( including cast-iron and steel pipe ) ; paper , lumber , and wood products ; mining ( mostly coal ) ; plastic products ; cars and trucks ; and apparel . 
Ala. is part of the largest industrial growth corridor in the nation . 
Alabama currently ranks 4th in the nation in automobile output . 
In the 1970s and 1980s , Birmingham 's economy was transformed by the University of Alabama at Birmingham ( UAB ) 's investments in bio-technology and medical research . 
UAB is now the area 's largest employer and the largest in Alabama , with a workforce of about 20,000 . 
Birmingham is also a leading U.S. banking center and the headquarters of Regions Financial Corporation , BBVA Compass and Superior Bancorp . 
In November 2006 , Regions Financial completed its merger with AmSouth Bancorporation , which was also headquartered in Birmingham . 
SouthTrust Corporation , another large bank headquartered in Birmingham , was acquired by Wachovia in 2004 for $ 14.3 billion . 
Birmingham also serves as the headquarters for several large investment management companies , including Harbert Management Corporation . 
Birmingham is also a powerhouse of construction and engineering companies . 
Huntsville has a technology-driven economy , a result of NASA 's Marshall Space Flight Center and the Redstone Arsenal . 
Huntsville 's main economic influence is derived from aerospace and military technology . 
The Port of Mobile is currently the 9th largest by tonnage in the United States . 
Alabama 's tax structure is one the most regressive in the United States . 
Ala. levies a 2 , 4 , or 5 percent personal income tax , depending upon the amount earned and filing status , though taxpayers can deduct their federal income tax from their Ala. state tax . 
For example , the total sales tax rate in Mobile is 9 % and there is an additional restaurant tax of 1 % , which means that a diner in Mobile would pay a 10 % tax on a meal . 
Sales and excise taxes in Ala. account for 51 percent of all state and local revenue , compared with an average of about 36 percent nationwide . 
Ala. is also one of the few remaining states that levies a tax on food and medicine . 
Alabama 's income tax on poor working families is among the nation 's very highest . 
[ citation needed ] Ala. is the only state that levies income tax on a family of four with income as low as $ 4,600 , which is barely one-quarter of the federal poverty line . 
[ citation needed ] Alabama 's threshold is the lowest among the 41 states and the District of Columbia with income taxes . 
The overall federal , state , and local tax burden in Alabama ranks the state as the second least tax-burdened state in the country . 
Since Alabama 's tax structure largely depends on consumer spending , it is subject to high variable budget structure . 
For example , in 2003 Alabama had an annual budget deficit as high as $ 670 million . 
Another interstate road , I-22 , is currently under construction . 
When completed around 2012 it will connect Birmingham with Memphis , Tennessee . 
Major airports in Alabama include Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport ( BHM ) , Huntsville International Airport ( HSV ) , Dothan Regional Airport ( DHN ) , Mobile Regional Airport ( MOB ) , Montgomery Regional Airport , Muscle Shoals -- Northwest Alabama Regional Airport , Tuscaloosa Regional Airport ( TCL ) , and Pryor Field Regional Airport ( DCU ) . 
There is a significant movement to rewrite and modernize Alabama 's constitution . 
This movement is based upon the fact that Alabama 's constitution highly centralizes power in Montgomery and leaves practically no power in local hands . 
Alabama is divided into three equal branches : The legislative branch is the Alabama Legislature , a bicameral assembly composed of the Alabama House of Representatives , with 105 members , and the Alabama Senate , with 35 members . 
It is headed by the Governor of Alabama . 
The highest court is the Supreme Court of Alabama . 
Alabama has 67 counties . 
Alabama is an alcoholic beverage control state ; the government holds a monopoly on the sale of alcohol . 
The Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court is Democrat Sue Bell Cobb . 
Since then , Republicans have become increasingly competitive in Ala. politics . 
Republicans hold an 8 -- 1 majority on the Alabama Supreme Court and have a 5 -- 2 majority among statewide elected executive branch offices . 
Alabama state politics gained nationwide and international attention in the 1950s and 1960s during the American Civil Rights Movement , when majority whites bureaucratically , and at times , violently resisted protests for electoral and social reform . 
In 2004 , George W. Bush won Alabama 's nine electoral votes by a margin of 25 percentage points with 62.5 % of the vote , mostly white voters . 
While Alabama 's public education system has improved , it lags behind in achievement compared to other states . 
Alabama 's programs of higher education include 14 four-year public universities , two-year community colleges , and 17 private , undergraduate and graduate universities . 
Achilles also has the attributes of being the most handsome of the heroes assembled against Troy . 
Achilles chased Hector around the wall of Troy three times before Athena , in the form of Hector 's favorite and dearest brother , Deiphobus , persuaded Hector to stop running and fight Achilles face to face . 
The final passage in the Iliad is Hector 's funeral , after which the doom of Troy was just a matter of time . 
Some retellings also state that Achilles was scaling the gates of Troy and was hit with a poisoned arrow . 
The heroic cult of Achilles on Leuce island was widespread in antiquity , not only along the sea lanes of the Pontic Sea but also in maritime cities whose economic interests were tightly connected to the riches of the Black Sea . 
Leuce had also a reputation as a place of healing . 
Some post-Homeric sources claim that in order to keep Achilles safe from the war , Thetis ( or , in some versions , Peleus ) hides the young man at the court of Lycomedes , king of Skyros . 
Odysseus goes to Skyros in the guise of a peddler selling women 's clothes and jewelry and places a shield and spear among his goods . 
His tenure in office was occupied primarily with the defeat of the secessionist Confederate States of America in the American Civil War . 
Lincoln successfully defused the Trent affair , a war scare with Britain late in 1861 . 
Abraham Lincoln was born on February 12 , 1809 , to Thomas Lincoln and Nancy Lincoln ( née Hanks ) , two farmers , in a one-room log cabin on the 348-acre ( 1.4 km 2 ) Sinking Spring Farm in southeast Hardin County , Kentucky ( now part of LaRue County ) , making him the first president born in the west . 
Thomas Lincoln was a respected citizen of rural Ky. . 
He owned several farms , including the Sinking Spring Farm , although he was not wealthy . 
Lincoln later noted that this move was " partly on account of slavery, " and partly because of difficulties with land deeds in Kentucky . 
Unlike land in the Northwest Territory , Kentucky never had a proper U.S. survey , and farmers often had difficulties proving title to their property . 
In 1830 , fearing a milk sickness outbreak , the family settled on public land in Macon County , Illinois . 
Later that year , hired by New Salem businessman Denton Offutt and accompanied by friends , he took goods from New Salem to New Orleans via flatboat on the Sangamon , Ill. and Mississippi rivers . 
He met her when he first moved to New Salem , and by 1835 they had reached a romantic understanding . 
In 1840 , Lincoln became engaged to Mary Todd , from a wealthy slaveholding family based in Lexington , Ky. . 
The Lincolns soon had a budding family , with the birth of son Robert Todd Lincoln in Springfield , Illinois on August 1 , 1843 , and second son Edward Baker Lincoln on March 10 , 1846 , also in Springfield . 
Edward Lincoln died on February 1 , 1850 in Springfield , likely of tuberculosis . 
But Willie himself died of a fever at the age of eleven on February 20 , 1862 , in Washington , D.C. , during President Lincoln 's first term . 
The Lincolns ' fourth son Thomas " Tad " Lincoln was born on April 4 , 1853 , and , although he outlived his father , died at the age of eighteen on July 16 , 1871 in Chicago . 
He was esteemed by the residents of New Salem , but he did not have an education , powerful friends , or money . 
The centerpiece of his platform was the undertaking of navigational improvements on the Sangamon River . 
Before the election he served as a captain in a company of the Illinois militia during the Black Hawk War , although he never saw combat . 
When the votes were counted , Lincoln finished eighth out of thirteen candidates ( only the top four were elected ) , but he did manage to secure 277 out of the 300 votes cast in the New Salem precinct . 
Admitted to the bar in 1837 , he moved to Springfield , Illinois , that April , and began to practice law with John T. Stuart , Mary Todd 's cousin , who let Lincoln have the run of his law library while studying to be a lawyer . 
He served four successive terms in the Illinois House of Representatives as a representative from Sangamon County , affiliated with the Whig party . 
Lincoln 's main stand against Polk occurred in his Spot Resolutions : The war had begun with a violent confrontation on territory disputed by Mexico and Tex. , but as Lincoln pointed out , Polk had insisted that Mexican soldiers had " invaded our territory and shed the blood of our fellow-citizens on our own soil . " 
Congress never enacted the resolution or even debated it , and its introduction resulted in a loss of political support for Lincoln in his district ; one Ill. newspaper derisively nicknamed him " spotty Lincoln . " 
Taylor won and his administration offered him the governorship of the Oregon Territory . 
The territory leaned heavily Democratic , and Lincoln doubted they would elect him as governor or as a senator after they were admitted to the union , so he returned to Springfield without any appointment . 
Back in Springfield , Lincoln turned most of his energies to making a living practicing law , handling " every kind of business that could come before a prairie lawyer . " 
The idea was never commercialized , but Lincoln is still the only person to hold a patent and serve as President of the United States . 
He won this case , and the decision by the Illinois Supreme Court was eventually cited by 25 other courts throughout the United States . 
Lincoln appeared in front of the Illinois Supreme Court 175 times , 51 times as sole counsel , of which , 31 were decided in his favor . 
According to a newspaper account of the speech , Lincoln spoke with " a thin high-pitched falsetto voice of much carrying power , that could be heard a long distance in spite of the hustle and bustle of the crowd ... [ with ] the accent and pronunciation peculiar to his native state , Kentucky . " 
On May 18 , at the 1860 Republican National Convention in Chicago , Lincoln emerged as the Republican candidate on the third ballot , beating candidates such as William H. Seward and Salmon P. Chase . 
Bell won Va. , Tenn. , and Kentucky , and Breckinridge won the rest of the South . 
On December 20 , 1860 , S.C. took the lead ; by February 1 , 1861 , Florida , Mississippi , Alabama , Georgia , Louisiana , and Tex. had followed . 
The seven states soon declared themselves to be a new nation , the Confederate States of America . 
The upper South ( Delaware , Maryland , Virginia , N.C. , Tennessee , Ky. , Missouri , and Arkansas ) listened to , but initially rejected , the secessionist appeal . 
President Buchanan and President-elect Lincoln refused to recognize the Confederacy . 
would lose us everything we gained in the election ; that filibustering for all South of us , and making slave states of it , would follow in spite of us , under either plan, " while another Republican Congressman warned it " would amount to a perpetual covenant of war against every people , tribe , and state owning a foot of land between here and Tierra del Fuego . " 
The Confederate States of America selected Jefferson Davis on February 9 , 1861 , as their provisional President . 
North Carolina , Tennessee , and Arkansas also voted for secession over the next two months . 
Missouri , Kentucky and Maryland threatened secession , but neither they nor the slave state of Delaware seceded . 
George William Brown , the Mayor of Baltimore , and other suspect Maryland politicians were arrested and imprisoned at Fort McHenry . 
Rebel leaders were also arrested and held in military prisons without trial . 
Pope complied with Lincoln 's strategic desire to move toward Richmond from the north , thus protecting the capital from attack . 
In response to his failure , Pope was sent to Minnesota to fight the Sioux . 
Burnside had promised to follow through on Lincoln 's strategic vision for a strong offensive against Lee and Richmond . 
After Burnside was stunningly defeated at Fredericksburg in December , Joseph Hooker took command , despite his history of " loose talk " and criticizing former commanders . 
Hooker was routed by Lee at the Battle of Chancellorsville in May , 1863 , but continued to command his troops for roughly two months . 
In a letter to Andrew Johnson , the military governor of Tenn. , encouraging him to lead the way in raising black troops , Lincoln wrote , " The bare sight of fifty thousand armed , and drilled black soldiers on the banks of the Mississippi would end the rebellion at once . " 
After the Union victory at Gettysburg , Meade 's failure to pursue Lee and months of inactivity for the Army of the Potomac persuaded Lincoln that a change was needed . 
Responding to criticism of Grant after the 1862 battle of Shiloh , Lincoln reportedly had said , " I ca n't spare this man . 
The Confederacy was out of replacements , so Lee 's army shrank with every battle , forcing it back to trenches outside Petersburg . 
In April 1865 , Lee 's army finally crumbled under Grant 's pounding , and Richmond fell . 
The damage caused by Sherman 's March to the Sea through Ga. totaled more than $ 100 million by the general 's own estimate . 
Lincoln grasped the need to control strategic points ( such as the Mississippi River and the fortress city of Vicksburg ) and understood the importance of defeating the enemy 's army , rather than simply capturing territory . 
He expected to cause the eventual extinction of slavery by stopping its further expansion into any U.S. territory , and by persuading states to accept compensated emancipation if the state would outlaw slavery . 
In it , he stated that " as a fit and necessary military measure " on January 1 , 1863 , " all persons held as a slaves " in the Confederate states will " thenceforward , and forever , be free . " 
As Frederick Douglass observed , Lincoln was , " The first great man that I talked with in the United States freely who in no single instance reminded me of the difference between himself and myself , of the difference of color . " 
Although the Battle of Gettysburg was a Union victory , it was also the bloodiest battle of the war and dealt a blow to Lincoln 's war effort . 
This goal became the focus of his address at the Gettysburg battlefield cemetery on November 19 . 
In just over two minutes , Lincoln invoked the principles of human equality espoused by the Declaration of Independence and redefined the Civil War as a struggle not merely for the Union , but as " a new birth of freedom " that would bring true equality to all of its citizens , and that would also create a unified nation in which states ' rights were no longer dominant . 
Of special importance were Tennessee , where Lincoln appointed Andrew Johnson as governor , and La. , where Lincoln attempted a plan that would restore statehood when 10 % of the voters agreed to it . 
This allowed the president to confer in person with Grant and Sherman about ending hostilities ( as Sherman coincidentally managed a hasty visit to Grant from his forces in North Carolina at the same time ) . 
Learning that the President and First Lady would be attending Ford 's Theatre , he laid his plans , assigning his co-conspirators to assassinate Vice President Andrew Johnson and Secretary of State William H. Seward . 
He was eventually cornered in a Va. barn house and shot , dying of his wounds soon after . 
The President was taken across the street from the theater to the Petersen House , where he lay in a coma for nine hours before dying . 
Lincoln 's body was carried by train in a grand funeral procession through several states on its way back to Illinois . 
While much of the nation mourned him as the savior of the United States , Copperheads celebrated the death of a man they considered a tyrant . 
The Lincoln Tomb in Oak Ridge Cemetery in Springfield , Illinois , is 177 feet ( 54 m ) tall and , by 1874 , was surmounted with several bronze statues of Lincoln . 
In March 1860 in a speech in New Haven , Connecticut , Lincoln said , regarding slavery , " Whenever this question shall be settled , it must be settled on some philosophical basis . 
Lincoln has been memorialized in many town , city , and county names , including the capital of Nebraska . 
Lincoln , Illinois , is the only city to be named for Abraham Lincoln before he became President . 
In addition , New Salem , Illinois ( a reconstruction of Lincoln 's early adult hometown ) , Ford 's Theatre , and Petersen House ( where he died ) are all preserved as museums . 
The state nickname for Illinois is Land of Lincoln ; the slogan has appeared continuously on nearly all Illinois license plates issued since 1954 . 
When I-80 was completed in 1969 , the head was moved to the current site . 
Aristotle was born in Stageira , Chalcidice , in 384 BC , about 55 km ( 34 mi ) east of modern-day Thessaloniki . 
At about the age of eighteen , he went to Athens to continue his education at Plato 's Academy . 
Aristotle was appointed as the head of the royal academy of Macedon . 
By 335 BC he had returned to Athens , establishing his own school there known as the Lyceum . 
However , he died in Euboea of natural causes within the year ( in 322 BC ) . 
Aristotle certainly did research on the natural history of Lesbos , and the surrounding seas and neighbouring areas . 
The most striking passages are about the sea-life visible from observation on Lesbos and available from the catches of fishermen . 
Second , there is " incontrovertible evidence, " Lord says , that the treatises were in circulation during the time in which Strabo and Plutarch suggest they were confined within the cellar in Scepsis . 
In places like Sparta where the lot of women is bad , there can only be half-happiness in society . 
Inspired by time Gershwin had spent in Paris , it is in the form of an extended tone poem evoking the sights and energy of the French capital in the 1920s . 
Gershwin brought back some Parisian taxi horns for the New York premiere of the composition which took place on December 13 , 1928 in Carnegie Hall with Walter Damrosch conducting the New York Philharmonic .
